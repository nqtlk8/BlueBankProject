Project : Blue Bank Loan Analysis

Blue Bank is a bank in USA that has a loan department which is currently understaffed.
They supply loans to individuals and don’t have much reporting on how risky these
borrowers are.
Using Python and Tableau, they’d like to see a report of borrowers who may have
issues paying back the loan.
